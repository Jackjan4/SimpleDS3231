# SimpleDS3231

A powerful but also beginner-friendly library that enables support for the DS3231 Real-Time-Clock module.


## Motivation

I (Jan) created this library due to the fact that most other libraries for the DS3231 are either missing important features (such as the alarm) or are difficult to use for beginners that don't know how to fiddle with registers.

Unhappy with this situation I created SimpleDS3231 with the goal to be the ultimate library for the DS3231 featuring:

- **Easy syntax**
- **Rich documentation**
- **Beginner friendly** - SimpleDS3231 features a rich documentation and a straightforward syntax
- **Complete feature set** - While keeping things simple, this library supports all of the features the DS3231 has to offer
- **Advanced features** - Advanced users can use special functions like direct-register-access-functions to speak directly to the DS3231 registers
- **
