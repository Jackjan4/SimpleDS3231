# SimpleDS3231

A powerful but also beginner-friendly library that enables support for the DS3231 Real-Time-Clock module.


## Motivation

I (Jan) created this library due to the fact that most other libraries for the DS3231 are either missing important features (such as the alarm) or are difficult to use for beginners that don't know how to fiddle with registers.

Unhappy with this situation I created SimpleDS3231 with the goal to be the ultimate library for the DS3231 featuring:

- Easy syntax - Get the DS3231 to work with just a couple of lines of code
- Complete feature set - While being simple this library supports all of the features the DS3231 has to offer
- Advanced features -
